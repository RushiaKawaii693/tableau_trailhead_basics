# Reflection:
Data storytelling emphasizes that graphics are only important when they support a clear narrative, which struck with me since it challenges you to go beyond charts and focus on the "why."  One standout feature of Tableau is how the data model separates logical and physical layers, making it easy to combine related tables without having to manually write joins every time.  That framework allows for flexibility in relationships while yet generating accurate outcomes.  A useful healthcare use case for Tableau would be to create a dashboard that analyzes patient readmission rates by condition, allowing doctors to recognize patterns, allocate resources, and intervene early with tailored therapies.  It's the type of tool that converts raw data into actionable decisions that improve treatment.
